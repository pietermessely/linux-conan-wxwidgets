# linux-conan-wxwidgets

Is a temporary recipy for wxwidgets because the original one here: https://github.com/bincrafters/conan-wxwidgets didn't work on my end and I tried fixing it, but there were too many variables to figure it out in a decent time. 
I plan to fix the official one when I get around to it and when I need to check my stuff out on windows platform ... 

Only works on linux for but checks out the last wxwidgets (will try to keep this up-to-date)
